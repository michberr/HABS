The main goals for this week were:

1) Explore synechococcus further:
    - are oligotype/MED results robust?
    - Email murat
    - can we really tell if the variation is just copy number variants? What about intraspecific variation

2) Explore limnohabitans:
    - it can be a phototroph or heterotroph
    - oligotype it 

3) Explore chloroplasts

4) look at correlations of environmental variables
 
5) Work on fixing Edna's code
